1_DELIM_WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD START 
2_DELIM_ AND JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE
3_DELIM_I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT QUE WHAT IS THIS MOVIE THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS
4_DELIM_I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
5_DELIM_ BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERES A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED
6_DELIM_FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
7_DELIM_ THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
8_DELIM_THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
9_DELIM_BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE
10_DELIM_ I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
11_DELIM_ I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
12_DELIM_ NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
13_DELIM_WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE
14_DELIM_AND NOW IM NOT IM NOT EXCITED ANYMORE
15_DELIM_ INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER
16_DELIM_ UM YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING
17_DELIM_YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES
18_DELIM_ MATT DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
19_DELIM_BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSFUL PARTS
20_DELIM_ OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES
21_DELIM_ AND JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING
22_DELIM_I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON
23_DELIM_BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
