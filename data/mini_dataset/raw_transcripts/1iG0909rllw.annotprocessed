1_DELIM_AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
2_DELIM_ LETS FACE IT THEY ARE REALLY NOT MASTER PIECES
3_DELIM_I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
4_DELIM_UM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD ITS FLAWS
5_DELIM_ BUT CINEMATICLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
6_DELIM_ IT WASIT WAS ENJOYABLE
7_DELIM_I WASNT THINKING ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WEITZ WAS GONNA START THE NEW MOON BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS PHILLIP PULLMAN THE GOLDEN COMPASS
8_DELIM_I THOUGHT THAT FILM WAS AWFUL
9_DELIM_AND I I DIDINT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NEW MOON UM IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
10_DELIM_OVERALL NEW MOON WAS IT WAS OK JUST AVERAGE
11_DELIM_ THE THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
12_DELIM_ ITS VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK 
13_DELIM_AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY
14_DELIM_UM HOWEVER IT IS THIS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS
15_DELIM_AND THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER
16_DELIM_ I MEAN THE ENTIRE XXX IS BELLA SWAN KRISTEN KRISTENS STEWARDS CHARACTER MOBBING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
17_DELIM_ IT WASNT REALLY THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER ILL SAY THAT
18_DELIM_SO OVERALLNEW MOON EVEN WITH THE BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS HUH IT WAS STILL TOO LONG 
19_DELIM_ THE ANGSTY TOO ANGSTY MOMENTS WITHDRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS THAY CAN GO
20_DELIM_AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
21_DELIM_ I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
22_DELIM_BUT AT THE SAME GOES FOR ROB PATTINSON AS EDWARD AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF FROWNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN
23_DELIM_FOR THE MOMENT IN THIS THE WHOLE CINEMA WAS LAUGHTING
24_DELIM_AND YOU KNEW YOU SHOULDNT BE LAUGHING
25_DELIM_ MY FAVORITE SCENE WOULD DEFINATELY BE THE VOLTURI
26_DELIM_ UM THEN MY WINS ON SCREEN WISKERS I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY WORN IN A LOTS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT XXX REALLY RATHER GOOD 
27_DELIM_AND UM MICHAEL SHEEN AS ARO AS WELL HE WAS RATHER ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
28_DELIM_ AND I THINK THE VOLTURI THAT WAS MY EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
29_DELIM_THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST MOB AROUND 
30_DELIM_AND THAT WAS REALLY BORING
