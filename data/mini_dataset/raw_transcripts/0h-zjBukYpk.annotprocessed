1_DELIM_NOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL
2_DELIM_NOW IM NOT EVEN GONNA SUGAR COAT THIS THIS MOVIE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM
3_DELIM_MY REASON IM A COMIC BOOK FAN
4_DELIM_THAT LIKE TO SEE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLY
5_DELIM_ THAT HUH BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST 
6_DELIM_STRANGE SINCE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GRAPES WITH THE XMAN SERIES WAS AND ALWAYS IS THE XXX
7_DELIM_ NOW HUGH JACKMAN WAS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE TO PLAY WOLVERINE I WILL ADMIT THAT
8_DELIM_ AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
9_DELIM_YOU KNOW NOTHING GREAT 
10_DELIM_BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
11_DELIM_ HES A STAR OF THE MOVIE
12_DELIM_ NOTHING SPECIAL
13_DELIM_ HE CARRIED IT
14_DELIM_WHICH IS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HES NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
15_DELIM_BUT ITS PRETTY SELFEXPLANATORY
16_DELIM_ UM I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIEV SCHREIBER IS A GOOD ACTOR
17_DELIM_AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
18_DELIM_ I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
19_DELIM_NOW OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE BORDERLINE
20_DELIM_ OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT
21_DELIM_ ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT
22_DELIM_ AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER
23_DELIM_ NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME
24_DELIM_I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE 
25_DELIM_I LIKED THAT SCENE WHERE HE HAD A SWORDS IN THERE AND THERES BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA SHOOT HIM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM TAKE HIM DOWN TAKE HIM DOWN BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS
