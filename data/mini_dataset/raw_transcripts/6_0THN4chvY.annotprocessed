1_DELIM_AND SO I WAS KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE MAYBE IF THAT WAS WHAT DISNEY WAS GOING FOR AND IT DEFINATELY WAS WHAT THAY WERE GOING FOR
2_DELIM_BUT I BET IF YOU PUT THEM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM THAT THE STYLE WOULD BE SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
3_DELIM_ UM ITS ITS GREAT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT WAS OLD FILMS 
4_DELIM_ WOULD BE GREAT FOR KIDS TOO
5_DELIM_THE STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE
6_DELIM_WEVE GOT GREAT JOKES
7_DELIM_ UM FUNNY JOKES THAT THE KIDS WOULD GET
8_DELIM_UM I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE EEYORE AND POOH THINK THAT OWL IS GETTING SICK
9_DELIM_BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND THEY THINK HE IS SAYING AT YOU
10_DELIM_UM THAT WAS PROBABLY PART OF THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO GO AND SEE THE MOVIE
11_DELIM_BEACUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY COULD FRAME THAT 
12_DELIM_SO UM IF YOU HAVENT SEEN WINNIE THE POOH AND YOU LIKE FAMILY FILMS GO SEE IT
13_DELIM_ITS A GREAT ONE
14_DELIM_ I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND IT
