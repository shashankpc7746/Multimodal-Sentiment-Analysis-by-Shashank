1_DELIM_ UM IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM 
2_DELIM_BUT MOSTLY IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS OF WHY I DONT THINK HES GONNA BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS
3_DELIM_UM WHICH I THINK RODRIGEZ WAS GOING FOR HE TH TH HE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THE SEQUEL UM HE WANTED THIS TO BE UM TH THE PREDATOR EQUIVALENT OF ALIENS
4_DELIM_UM AS UM YOU KNOW AS ALIENS WAS TO ALIEN 
5_DELIM_UM AND IM GONNA REALLY POINT OUT WHY THAT I DONT THINK HE REALLY PULLED HE PULLED THAT OFF
6_DELIM_UM WHY WAS A MISTAKE REALLY TO TRY AND DO THAT 
7_DELIM_UM BUT I DID ENJOY IT
8_DELIM_ SO UM IM GONNA POINT OUT THE STUFF I DID LIKE THERE WERE SOME ACTION SCENES IN IT
9_DELIM_THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED UM NOT ALL OF THE CHARACTERS
10_DELIM_ BUT UM I WOULD SAY THAT UM THERE WAS THERES GOOD THERE WERE FOUR GOOD CHARACTERS IN THERE 
11_DELIM_UM I I LIKED AGENT BRODYS CHARACTER
12_DELIM_ I THOUGHT HE WAS UM WELL DEVELOPED
13_DELIM_ YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
14_DELIM_SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT
15_DELIM_I LIKED THE GIRL WHO WAS THE ISRAELI SNIPER

17_DELIM_UM I LIKED THE RUSSIAN GUY JURI 
18_DELIM_ UM YOU CARED YOU THERE WAS ENOUGH IN THERE FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM
19_DELIM_AND XXX WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER 
20_DELIM_UM HE HAD SOME FUNNY HE HAD A FEW ONE LINES THAT WAS QUITE QUITE FUNNY
21_DELIM_ YEAH ONCE UNFORTUNATELY UM I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY THEY JUST WERENT UM DEVELOPED ENOUGH FEAR TO CARE ABOUT THEM UM AND THAT INCLUDES IS IT TOPHER GRACES I THINK I THINK HIS NAME WAS INCLUDS HIS CHARACTER UM
22_DELIM_ UM I JUST DIDNT THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UM I ALSO I I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL 
23_DELIM_WHO I THINK RODRIGEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE MO WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALIPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER
24_DELIM_ BUT HE ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WITH PREDATOR TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO PREDATOR
25_DELIM_PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE
26_DELIM_AND IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EV EVEN IN THE SAME XXX WHERE THEY THEY SLOW YOU KNOW THEY MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YO YOU KNOW 
27_DELIM_IT FELT THE MOVIE SLOWED DOWN WHERES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
28_DELIM_WHEN WHEN THEY THEY WITH UM LAURENCE FISHBURNE CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
29_DELIM_ I DIDNT REALLY FEEL UM THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARATER WAS NECESSARY
30_DELIM_UM IT COULDVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT
