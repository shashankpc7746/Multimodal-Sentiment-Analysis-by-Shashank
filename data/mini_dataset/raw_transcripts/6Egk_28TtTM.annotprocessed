1_DELIM_ I JUST GOT FINISHED WATCHING AN EXCELLENT MOVIE CALLED MARS NEEDS MOMS
2_DELIM_AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILOS MOTHER AND GRIBBLE
3_DELIM_I LIKED GRIBBLE BECAUSE HE HELPED MILO GET MILOS MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIANS
4_DELIM_WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AWESOME
5_DELIM_ AND MY FAVORITE PART IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MILO HAS TO SAVE GRIBBLE
6_DELIM_AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES 3 AND UP
7_DELIM_BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE
8_DELIM_AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEEL LIKE SEE THE MOVIE
9_DELIM_ LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL
10_DELIM_ I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY S KIND OF SCARY
11_DELIM_AND I THINK I WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY OWN MOTHER
12_DELIM_BUT IT ALL TURNS OUT GREAT IN THE END
